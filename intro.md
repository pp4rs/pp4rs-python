# Welcome

This book contains the lecture notes for the Python part of [Programming Practices for Research in Economics][pp4rs].

We have divided the book into two parts:

1. "Introduction to Python" which provides an in introduction to Python assuming no existing knowledge.
2. "Python for Scientific Computing" which discusses some additional Python packages that can be useful for economics research. This section is not comprehensive in the current state, but discusses what we feel is the most useful tools to get up and running

Check out the content using the sidebar to get access to individual lecture notes along with exercises and solutions.
