    "In the Python classes to date (ADD LINKS) we discussed some important programming basics and learnt some important fundamentals of the Python language. This is rarely enough to do scientific research on its own.\n",

    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we introduce the `NumPy` module, which is perhaps *the* fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Numpy provides the core tool of scientific computing, N-dimensional arrays, as well as tools to work with these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's N-dimensional array and functionality gives us, the user, efficient storage and operations on arrays - even when they grow large in size.\n",
    "\n",
